# ExpenseCalculator
Calculates your monthly total expenses and income by scanning your bank account transactions. 

Takes as input a transaction file generated by your bank app.

Up until now all tools that help you calculate your monthly expenses require you to collect
and enter them into some sort of expense calculator. This requires a lot of effort and is 
error prone. 
This script extracts the information directly from your bank account transactions.
It will work well even if you have multiple bank accounts, investments and credit cards.
The only condition is that all your expenses eventually land in your current account. This is
the case for most people.


Contributers are welcome to add support for various banks file formats. 

Run as follows in Windows Terminal:

**python expenseCalculator.py Current Account_29052022_0749.xlsx**

You can run it in Windows cmd, but it does not support languages other than English.
however, Windows Powershell supports other languages. See testScriptForPowerShell.ps1 for examples.
