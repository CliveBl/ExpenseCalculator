# The Effortless Monthly Expense Calculator
#
# By Clive Bluston 
# 2nd June 2022
#
#  Up until now all tools that help you calculate your monthly expenses require you to collect
# and enter them into some sort of expense calculator. This requires a lot of effort and is 
# error prone. 
# This script extracts the information directly from your bank account transactions.
# It will work well even if you have multiple back accounts, investments and credit cards.
# The only condition is that all your expenses eventually land in your current account. This is
# the case for most people.
# 
# The script is based on the English Excel generated by Bank Discount.
# It can be modified for other Banks and languages just by creating a new subclass of TransactionAnalyzer
# Use TransactionAnalyzer_BankDiscountEnglish as a template.
#

# You may need to make the following installs
# python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
# pip install pandas
# pip install openpyxl
#
# Generate an Excel file of your transactions as follows:
# 1. Login to Bank in a browser
# 2. Set to English (Hebrew can be supported by adjusted the script)
# 3. Go to your Current Account transactions.
# 4. Select 12 months of transactions using the menu.
# 5. Select Export to Excel using the Export menu.
# 6. Save the file.
# Run as follows:
# python expenseCalc.py Current Account_29052022_0749.xlsx

# Imports
import pandas as pd
import re
import sys
import datetime

    # Abstract class. You need to create a subclass for each Bank

    # Analyze the transaction file.
    # Parameters:
